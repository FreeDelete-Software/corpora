# corpora
JSON data files for [pyprocgen](https://github.com/FreeDelete-Software/pyprocgen). Some may be crucial to the way pyprocgen works.

## Copyright
This data is largely derived from https://github.com/dariusk/corpora and public domain resources. In turn, this information is available under CC0 license terms.

## Not a fork. Not affiliated. Not compatible.
While a lot of this is (or will be) taken from the dariusk repository, it has a more specific and unrelated purpose. As such, the JSON files will probably be changed so much that they will be incompatible with anything which uses that data.

## In a nutshell
This is basically just example data for pyprocgen.
